# DSA
This is a repo where I will practice DSA and record all self-study that I do in the topic. I will attempt to solve problems using Python or JS or C sometimes.

They won't necessarily be LeetCode problems. But they will be problems at varying difficulties (I will start with easy ones).
I don't have much experience with DSA because I'm not from a CS background, so commits will be sporadic.
